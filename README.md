# ultimate-manufacturing
Thoughts about ultimate ways for manufacturing.



## Ideas
- 3D printing is great for rapid prototyping and small yields
- Container shapes (TODO: Use table, search "markdown table in github"):
    - Rectangular:
        - Pro: Packs efficiently, easy to add label
        - Con: Requires more materials to produce
    - Cylindrical:
        - Pro: Requires less materials to produce, high natural structural integrity
        - Con: Packs inefficiently
    - Spherical:
        - Pro: Requires least materials to produce, high natural structural integrity, unique shape for customers
        - Con: Packs inefficiently, rolls, labelling is more difficult
    - Other:
        - Pro: Most unique shape for customers
        - Con: Packs least efficiently, labelling is most difficult
